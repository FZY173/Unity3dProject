Introduction
------------

The Extreme Optimization Numerical Libraries for .NET are a solid foundation for your 
numerical computing needs on the Microsoft .NET platform, including .NET Core and on Linux.

Its broad base of algorithms covers a wide range of numerical techniques, including: 
linear algebra, numerical integration and differentiation, solving equations, optimization,
curve fitting, statistical models, and much more.

The classes in the Extreme Optimization Numerical Libraries for .NET and the relationships 
between them match our every-day concepts, and breaks new ground in usability for 
numerical software development.

We implemented the best algorithms available today to provide you with great performance 
on a robust, fast toolset.
